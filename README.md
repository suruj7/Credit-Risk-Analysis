	Predicted the risk of client default using XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.
	Used the dataset of NUBANK (Digital Bank) containing 43 features of 45000 clients.
	Treated outliers and missing values and removed variables which were adding no values to the model.
	Used 3 Gradient boosting algorithms of which XGBoost yielded the best results, with a recall rate of 81%.
